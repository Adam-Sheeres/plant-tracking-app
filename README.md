# 4030_Project
Project for CIS*4030

This is an ongoing project. The end goal will be a plant-tracking app. A plant-tracking app is meant to send the user reminders on when to water the plant. It also allows the user to input information about the plant to the "Info" page for a certain plant. I.e. they could input "light level" or something similar. 

Dart Flutter is being used as a SDK to develop this app.  

This is currently a starting position featuring the same layout, but different content for the plant tracking app. I will need to make some changes to it and how it works in order to get it to a place where I want it.
